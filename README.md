# Genshin Utilities Website

This is a starting project, we are testing the grounds since it's our first time doing a project in Svelte.

## How to start developing:

1. Clone the repository and change your working directory to the repository main directory.

2. Enssure that you have NodeJS installed, and then run `npm install` on the repository.

3. To run the website in `dev-mode` (where a webserver runs and updates if you change a file) use `npm run dev`.

4. To format the code run `npm run format`.

5. To lint the code run `npm run lint`.
